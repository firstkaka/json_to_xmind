# json_to_xmind
A python3 script translate json to xmind

### required python3 package
xmind == 1.2.0

### using  
`pip3 install xmind==1.2.0`

### motivation:  
  Often need to compare or clarify message with colleagues.  
  So I write this simple script to translate a json code to xmind, which I think is more user-friendly.  
  Test the latest official xmind app. The output crashed.   
  But recommend you to use https://naotu.baidu.com to upload the output file to generate the xmind file.  
   `~_~`

## usages:

  `python3 json_2_xmind.py your_json_name.json your_output_name.xmind`
